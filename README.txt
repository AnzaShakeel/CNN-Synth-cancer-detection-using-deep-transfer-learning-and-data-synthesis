# SenseOrPass - Proteomic Cancer Classifier

This project implements a deep learning classifier trained on proteomic biomarker data filtered by a predefined protein list. It includes model evaluation using ROC/AUC and SHAP interpretability.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `notebooks/` â€“ Jupyter notebook with complete pipeline
- `src/` â€“ Modular Python scripts for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- `data/` â€“ Selected protein list and input data
- `outputs/` â€“ Trained models and plots
